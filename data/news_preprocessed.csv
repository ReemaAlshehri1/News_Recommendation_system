The Battles began on The Voice Monday, with a new set of mentors (Usher, Darius Rucker, Normani, and wil.i.am) and a new rule allowing coaches to save one contestant each from elimination. But before all that, there were a few more Blind Auditions, including one form Season 17's new heartthrob, Matthew McQueen. He may not be related to Steve McQueen, but he had undeniable star power -- with a pretty face and a pretty voice to match plus just the right about of darkness and edge. ""He kind of looks like a combination of Tom Cruise and Christian Bale. You're like a very handsome movie villain,"" John Legend told Matthew. ""Like a vampire. You could be in a vampire movie,"" said Kelly Clarkson, who seemed a little flustered as she called the 21-year-old indie-pop crooner ""so cool and sexy -- I mean, not in a weird way!"" Blake Shelton compared Matthew's modern-sounding vocals to that of another heartthrob, Shawn Mendes. So I guess music really was in Matthew's, um, blood. [insert/quote some tweets] Matthew's cover artist-of-the-moment's Lewis Capaldi's weeper ""Someone You Loved"" was haunting, and not just because he looked like Lestat while singing it. I was impressed by his sense of dynamics, the way he started soft and subtle and built the song to its anguished crescendo, instead of starting at full volume. It was a sophisticated and nuanced performance. ""You got better and better and you kept it classy, you kept it tasteful. When you get into that rasp -- like, whew,"" Kelly marveled. It seemed like Kelly might be on her way to a third victory by getting Matthew on her team, but unfortunately for her, Blake also turned around. He made a very good case, noting that three of his past six winners were not country singers, stating, ""It doesn't matter what lane your coach is in. It's what lane your coach can put you in."" Combine that with the fact that Grandma McQueen had dreamed that Blake would turn for Matthew, and it was a done deal. Now Blake might win again with another non-country artist. ""With his range and his pocket -- this guy is a threat to this entire competition,"" Blake proclaimed."

Demi Moore got candid about a variety of topics in her new book, Inside Out, including her famous exes, substance abuse struggles and her heartbreaking sexual assault. ""The same question kept going through my head: How did I get here?"" the 56-year-old actress began in the memoir, which was released on Tuesday, September 24. ""The husband who I'd thought was the love of my life had cheated on me and then decided he didn't want to work on our marriage. My children weren't speaking me. … Is this life? I wondered. Because if this is it, I'm done."" Moore provided insight into all three of her marriages in the book. She was married to Freddy Moore from 1980 to 1985, Bruce Willis from 1987 to 2000 and Ashton Kutcher from 2005 to 2013. The end of the G.I. Jane star's relationship with the former That 70's Show star, however, seemed to have the biggest impact on her. ""I lost me,"" the Ghost actress told Diane Sawyer on Good Morning America on Monday, September 23, about their split. ""I think the thing if I were to look back, I would say I blinded myself and I lost myself."" Moore and Kutcher, who is 15 years her junior, started dating in 2003. After Us Weekly broke the news that he was allegedly unfaithful in 2011, the twosome called it quits. The Ranch star married Mila Kunis in July 2015. They share two kids: Wyatt, 4, and Dimitri, 2. Kutcher, for his part, reflected on the divorce during an appearance on Dax Shepard's ""Armchair Expert"" podcast last year. ""Right after I got divorced, I went to the mountains for a week by myself,"" Kutcher told Shepard in February 2018. ""I did no food, no drink   just water and tea. I took all my computers away, my phone, my everything. I was there by myself, so there was no talking. I just had a notepad, a pen and water and tea   for a week."" He referred to the trip as ""really spiritual and kind of awesome."" ""I wrote down every single relationship that I had where I felt like there was some grudge or some anything, regret, anything,"" Kutcher explained. ""And I wrote letters to every single person, and on day seven, I typed them all out and then sent them."" While Moore certainly doesn't hold back in Inside Out, a source told Us earlier this month that the Kutcher isn't worried about the book. ""Ashton knew what was coming. He had a heads up on what is in the book,"" the insider said on September 13. ""He's not mad or disappointed. This is Demi's truth, and he always felt sympathetic toward her. He knows her story and that her upbringing was difficult."" Inside Out is available now. Scroll through for 10 revelations from the book:"

N39708,video,animals,"Gigantic bull ""moos"" his appreciation when he gets his ear scratched. Gus is a 2,000 pound bull who lives on a beautiful farm in Millbrook, Ontario. He is a true gentle giant with a gentle disposition and a friendly nature. He wanders among his herd of cows who are also very happy here on this small chunk of paradise. They have hundreds of acres of lush, green meadow to graze on and ponds full of fresh water to drink. They even have a scratching post with brushes for soothing those itches. Gus is a big boy with big ears and a big itch inside one of them. He patiently waited for his turn at the post while Ethel had a good scratch. When he had the chance, he moved in for some relief. He rubbed his head and his ear and he seemed intent on trying to fit the big brush inside his ear to get at the right spot. Gus' buddy, Dave was watching all of this. Dave had come over for a visit that day, bringing Gus' favorite treat, an entire loaf of bread. Gus had devoured the loaf in under a minute and now he was a happy bull, except of the itch in his ear. Dave watched Gus trying his best to scratch that itch. In fact, the entire herd was gathered around Gus and they watched him as well. Eventually, Dave thought it best to lend a hand. Gus could use a little help from somebody with fingers and thumbs who could do a better job. Not all bulls would allow this, and not all bulls would even permit somebody to get so close to his females, but Gus is as relaxed as a bull can be. Dave walked up and started rubbing Gus' massive ear. Gus obviously appreciated the assistance and he moved his head to make things easier. He let out a few ""moos"" of contentment and then he wandered away. As Gus takes a few steps away from the brushes, we get a great look at his massive shoulders and rippling muscles. He weighs as much as ten very solid, grown men. Maybe it's because Gus isn't threatened by anything, or maybe it's sheer luck that he's so relaxed, but he doesn't ever react with aggression or hostility. Of course, trying to scratch the ear of a grown bull, or even getting this close to one, is not always wise. Gus is definitely an exception and, even at that, his massive size and strength make him an animal to be respected."

They were born just two days before this video was taken. The pigs are wild and they live on the edge of a jungle around a village on Vava'u Island in Tonga. Pigs are farmed here but they often run free, grazing and eating whatever they can find. Many pigs are fully wild, like this one and they can be seen foraging for food in compost heaps, farmer's fields, and under fruit trees. This very loving mother has ten piglets and they are extremely hungry. She lies down on the ground every few hours to let them feed. They nurse hungrily, climbing on each other adorably as they scramble for a chance at the best milk. This mother was also seen hiding her piglets in a little thicket so she could lie down beside them and sleep. Fiercely protective, the mother pig would be a formidable opponent for any dog or other predator who decided to try harming one of these little piglets. They will feed and grow rapidly under her watchful eye. They will need to be fast and strong if they want to survive life in the jungle. Tonga is a beautiful Kingdom with islands surrounded by crystal blue water. A visit here is like stepping back in time as guests witness a simple lifestyle and traditional ways. The Kingdom has not been industrialized as heavily as North America or Europe, and the people here enjoy a beautiful and natural home. But life is also hard and they work for everything, including food. Pigs like these are harvested as a food source by many. Hopefully, these little piglets will learn quickly and keep their wits about them."

A home security service man was in for an ursine surprise when he left a customer's home in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, to find two bear cubs had trapped themselves in his van. Jeff Stokely had heard the insistent honking of a car horn from inside the home, so he expected to find that his van was blocking another motorist's way. Instead, he found two bear cubs trapped inside his van and pressing on the horn. Stokely told Storyful, ""They had opened the door and climbed in and closed the door and locked it with my key inside. I had to call my office to get the keypad door code to unlock it and let them out."" In this video, Stokely views the events alongside the homeowners   who, he said, were ""amused and excited"" by the event. He tells the impatient bear cubs, ""I'm gonna get you out!"" as they paw the van doors from the inside. When Stokely opens the back doors, they run away into a wooded area, before ""disappearing."" Stokely and the homeowners were concerned about the possible hidden presence of a mother bear nearby   who, as Stokely says in the video, ""could come running out from somewhere"" to protect her cubs. Stokely told Storyful, however, that he ""never saw mama bear anywhere."" Credit: Jeff Stokely via Storyful"

Thousands of dead fish lined the banks of Lake Pamamaroo in remote western New South Wales as waterways run dry in the drought-stricken region. In this drone footage, taken by filmmaker Rory McLeod on October 15, the fish can be seen coating the length of the parched body of water, part of the Menindee Lakes complex. McLeod told Guardian Australia that he believed as many as 5,000 fish may have died in the incident. However the vast majority were believed to be European carp, an invasive species, rather than the endangered native Murray cod. In a statement, the NSW Department of Primary Industries said the aerial footage was consistent with satellite images that showed the lake was ""almost completely dry"". It said fish kills in the Menindee lakes were usually dominated by the carp as they lacked the evolutionary response of native species to seek deep channels in dry conditions. Thousands of fish died in the Darling River system around Menindee earlier in the year, drawing outrage from locals who blamed mismanagement of the waterway. Credit: Rory McLeod via Storyful"
